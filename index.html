‎
‎I just want to take this moment to remind you how deeply I appreciate and love you. Thank you for being patient with my attitude, for understanding my moods, and for making my college life brighter and more meaningful. With you, everything feels lighter, happier, and less heavy.
‎
‎I love your smile. I love the way you carry yourself so confidently. I love the way you hug me—like it’s the safest place in the world. I love how sometimes I just want a simple kiss, but you always find a way to do that (😜). I love how focused and driven you are the way you focus on your work makes you look so pogiiiii. 
‎
‎I love how you hold my hand when we walk, and how you always place yourself on the outer side of the sidewalk to protect me. It may seem like a small thing, but to me, it means so much. I even love how you laugh at my jokes—even the corny ones (napaka fake). And yes, even the way you think deeply about things (though sometimes I tease you when you get a little too judgmental).
‎
‎I love how you let me be sweet and a little OA when it comes to you. I love you exactly as you are—no changes, no conditions.
‎
‎Thank you for loving me the way you do. I will always be grateful that I get to experience this kind of love with you.
‎
‎I love you so much, Langga. Mwaaaaa! 💋
